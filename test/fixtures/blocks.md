### Launch faster

There is no reason launching a new site should take months. Use Helix to shave off the cruft of legacy platforms and launch new sites in days or weeks, not months.

### Fastest Pages on the Web

### It’s about time to lose patience with slow sites

-   Half a second delay in page load time leads to 20% increase in bounce rate
-   53% of all mobile visits end prematurely if a page takes more than 3 seconds to load
-   2 seconds of load time or more drop conversion rates by 50%

### Don’t make your business wait for your content management system

-   Authors spend more time with data entry than writing content
-   Deadlines are frequently missed because content is hard to review
-   Unit costs for content are increasing

### Stop wasting developer time on framework churn

-   Heavyweight frameworks make it harder to find developers
-   Slower to build sites
-   Costly to implement changes

## How it works

![](./media_1d880e70c58ce53f10feeddfa2ddb0df91c27f6ad.png?width=750\&format=png\&optimize=medium)

### Create content in Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

Create a new folder in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint. Then create a new document and put some content in it.

### Share your folder with Project Helix.

After you create a page, head back to your folder and share it with Helix.

### See your site in action.

After you have added some content, shared with Project Helix, built a repo, and tied your repo to your content, you can see your site in action.

### What _is_ Helix? (if you like tech jargon)

Helix lets business users ingest and publish markdown documents and spreadsheets from Microsoft Office or Google Docs and Sheets into a scalable, distributed content repository and dynamically renders HTML (and JSON, webp, etc.) to produce fast websites and actively manages cache consistency with your existing CDN infrastructure.

Helix lets frontend devs develop and deploy the design and functionality of their website with CSS and JavaScript directly in their GitHub repos.
